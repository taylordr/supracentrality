This network encodes the exchange of mathematicians with PhD's between universities within the United States. The network is temporal, weighted and direction. 

Edges are defined by quadruples (i,j,w,t) so that weight w indicates the number of math PhD's that graduate from university i and later advise a PhD student at university j, and that student graduates in year t.
