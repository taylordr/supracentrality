# Supracentrality 
## Centrality Analysis for Multilayer, Multiplex and Temporal Networks

This Python code implements the experimental results described in the book chapter:

The supracentrality framework is also described in the following papers

[2] D Taylor, MA Porter and PJ Mucha (2021) "Tunable eigenvector-based centralities for multiplex and temporal networks." Multiscale Modeling & Simulation 19(1), 113-147. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02059]

The results shown in [2] and [3] were created using Matlab code.
