# Supracentrality 
## Centrality Analysis for Multilayer, Multiplex and Temporal Networks

This Matlab code implements the supracentrality framework described in the paper

D Taylor, MA Porter and PJ Mucha (2021) "Tunable eigenvector-based centralities for multiplex and temporal networks." Multiscale Modeling & Simulation 19(1), 113â€“147. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02059]

There are 3 demos that reproduce the results in paper.
